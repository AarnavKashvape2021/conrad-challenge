      "title": "The Problem",
      "description": "Low Earth Orbit is becoming increasingly congested with defunct satellites and debris that pose collision risks to active spacecraft. Many small satellites lack sufficient fuel, mass margin, or system complexity to perform reliable end-of-life deorbiting, leading to uncontrolled decay or long-term orbital pollution. Current propulsion-based solutions add cost, weight, and failure points, making responsible deorbiting difficult to standardize—especially for small and cost-sensitive missions."

    "innovation": {
      "title": "Our Innovation",
      "summary": "We propose a compact electrodynamic tether deorbiting system with a mechanically simple, dual-redundant deployment mechanism. Designed specifically for reliability and minimal mass, our system enables passive, fuel-free deorbiting at the end of a satellite’s mission, making responsible orbital disposal accessible to a wider range of spacecraft."

    "mission": {
      "title": "Mission",
      "description": "Our mission is to make safe and reliable satellite deorbiting a standard practice by developing a propellant-free electrodynamic tether system that operates using fundamental physics rather than consumable resources. By prioritizing simplicity, redundancy, and reliability, we aim to provide an end-of-life solution that satellite operators can trust—reducing orbital debris, preventing collisions, and preserving the long-term sustainability of Earth’s orbital environment."
    },
    "vision": {
      "title": "Vision",
      "description": "We envision a future where every satellite launched into orbit includes a dependable, low-risk deorbiting mechanism by design. In this future, Earth’s orbits remain usable, safe, and accessible for scientific, commercial, and humanitarian missions without the growing threat of debris accumulation."
    },
    "values": {
      "title": "Values",
      "description": "We are guided by responsibility toward the space environment, engineering simplicity over unnecessary complexity, and reliability through thoughtful redundancy. We value solutions rooted in physics, designed for real-world constraints, and built to serve the long-term interests of both space operators and society."

  "innovation": {
    "overview": {
      "title": "Overview",
      "description": "Our innovation is an electrodynamic tether–based deorbiting system designed for small satellites. Once deployed, the conductive tether interacts with Earth’s magnetic field to generate a Lorentz force that gradually reduces orbital energy, enabling controlled atmospheric reentry without the use of propellant. The system is lightweight, passive after deployment, and engineered for high reliability."
    },
    "howItWorks": {
      "title": "How It Works",
      "description": "When the conductive tether is deployed from the satellite, it moves through Earth’s magnetic field at orbital velocity. This motion induces an electric current along the tether, which in turn experiences a Lorentz force opposing the satellite’s direction of motion. This force continuously removes orbital energy, lowering the satellite’s altitude over time until it safely reenters the atmosphere and burns up."
